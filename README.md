This project takes an individual 10013 in the preterm births (PTB) dataset and gastric cancer (GC) as examples to illustrate the specific application of the mPHGR method. The input data can be changed with the other datasets if necessary.



Calculating microbiome personalized hyper-graph ranking (mPHGR) score

input data: The control group and the normalized species abundance data at different stages (contained within the folder "PTB10013" or "GC")

output data: scores\_array\_10013.txt (or score\_GC.txt)

running pipeline: mPHGR\_PTB.py (or mPHGR\_GC.py)
